    <p>Without any doubts, Android SDK has a poor documentations. There are pitfalls and traps about APIs without any mentions in SDK documentations.</p>  <p>1. WebView.clearHistory()</p>  <p>When there is only one item in WebView’s internal back/forward list, clearHistory() won’t clear anything. When there are more than one items in back/forward list, clearHistory() will clear all the items except the top one, or the current one.</p>  <p>The next question you might ask is when WebView adds an item to its back/forward list when loading a URL. By listening WebChromeClient.onProgressChanged(), we can know this, when new progress is bigger than 10, the loading URL will be added to its back/forward list. So when new progress is bigger than 10, loading URL becomes current item and thus you can clear previous loaded URLs by calling clearHistory().</p>
