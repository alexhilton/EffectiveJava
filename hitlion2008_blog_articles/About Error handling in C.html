    <p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms,sans-serif;">C Programming language itself doesn't provide any good mechanism for error<br />

handling. But standard library and Unix/Linux system calls do provide a<br />

convinient way to handle errors. External variable errno, function strerror and<br />

function perror from library &lt;errno.h&gt;, &lt;string.h&gt; and &lt;stdio.h&gt; are all the<br />

things you need to make your programs more robust.<br />

The general way to use errno to handle error is like this:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <textarea cols="50" rows="15" name="code" class="c-sharp">if ( (fp = fopen( filename, mode )) == NULL ) {
      fprintf( stderr, &quot;cannot open file %s: %s/n&quot;, filename, strerror( errno ) );
      return -1;
}</textarea>

&nbsp;<br />

if you want to print error messages onto standard output(screen), you can use<br />

&nbsp; perror as an alternative. <br />

&nbsp; perror( const char *msg );<br />

&nbsp; perror( msg ); is equal to printf( &quot;%s: %s/n&quot;, msg, strerror( errno ) );<br />

There is a little difference between perror and strerror, the former is more<br />

elegant and easier to use, but it can print messages on standard output only and<br />

its format is predefined which cannot be changed. strerror provides much more <br />

freedom. You can write the message to anywhere and use any format you want.<br />

<br />

We know something goes wrong according to the return value of some functions<br />

like fopen etc. Then we can retrieve the detail information of the error through<br />

errno and strerror and output the info to user or do some recovery operations.<br />

But many times, we cannot know abnormal things happened through return value.<br />

fgets, for instance, would return NULL if either EOF reached or error occured.<br />

For these situations, we need to check errno to see whehter error has occured.<br />

Before you do that you have to know two rules about errno: First, its value<br />

is never cleared by a routine if an error does not occur. Therefore, we should<br />

examine its value only when the return value from a function indicates that an<br />

error occurred. Second, the value of errno is never set to 0 by any of the<br />

functions, and none of the constants defined in &lt;errno.h&gt; has a value of 0. <br />

As a result, if you want to know whether there is an error through errno, you'd<br />

better initialize it, then see if it remains its initial value. Like this:<br />
<textarea cols="50" rows="15" name="code" class="cpp">errno = 0;
    /* some operation which an error might occur */
    if ( errno != 0 ) {
      /* an error has occured */
      fprintf( stderr, &quot;error: %s/n&quot;, strerror( errno ) );
      return -1;
}</textarea>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<br />

In addition, if you write some error handling routines for system calls, you'd<br />

better save the original errno. Because, an error could occur during your<br />

handling routine and errno could be overwritten. Take err_doit in comhdr.h for<br />

example:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <textarea cols="50" rows="15" name="code" class="cpp">static void err_doit( int errnoflag, const char *fmt, va_list ap ) {
        int errno_save;
        char buf[ MAXLINE ];
        errno_save = errno; /* value caller might want printed */
        vsprintf( buf, fmt, ap );
        if ( errnoflag ) {
          sprintf( buf+strlen(buf), &quot;: %s&quot;, strerror( errno_save) );
        }
        strcat( buf, &quot;/n&quot; );
        fflush( stdout ); /* in case stdout and stderr are the same */
        fputs( buf, stderr );
        fflush( NULL ); /* flushes all stdio output streams */
        return;
    }</textarea>
&nbsp;<br />

Here, vsprintf might fail and modify errno, if so, the following strerror(errno)<br />

will no longer be the original error. Therefore, we have to save a copy of errno<br />

in errno_save, just in case.<br />
