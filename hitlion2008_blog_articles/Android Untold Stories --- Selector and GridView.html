    <p><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selector in Android is one of 
problems confusing developers. The reason is that it is very hard for 
developers to control attributes of selector, for ListView and GridView 
in particular. The paddings of selector, for instance, are very 
confusing. If you use Android's resources, such as <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>android.R.drawable.gallery_thumb</em>

</span>

</span>

 <span style="font-size: large;">and set it as</span>

 <span style="font-size: large;">selector of GridView, the paddings are 
16px(in WVGA). These paddings will be adding around the view in GridView
 but inside the selector, which means the selector will be stretched to 
contain your view and the paddings. But, if you put the same resources 
in your own package's resource folder <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>/drawable/my_selector.xml</em>
</span>
, the 
images used in selector are the same. Set it as selector for GridView, 
the paddings are 0 and, what's worse, the selector won't be stretched to
 contain your view, which means the selector stays in its own size and 
might be smaller than your view. This is rather wierd and I wish the 
upcoming SDK release can fix such an issue.</span>

</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the difference between
 Android's resources and developer defined, such paddings of selector 
are unable to change for developers. Sometimes, our layout is a little 
bigger which almost reaches screen's edges. In such condition, after 
adding selector(Android's resource), the selector will stretch out of 
screen. This huants many developers a lot. It haunts me for a great 
while at least.</span>

</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To control the paddings, there are two ways:</span>

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: large;">1, also is the simpliest one, 
that is re-design the image resources to exactly fit your view. But this
 will limit the compatbility which will cause nightmare when 
maintaining.</span>

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: large;">2. Another way is implement desired 
GridView by yourself which enables you open interface to control these 
paddings when setting selectors. Note: simply inherit GridView or 
ListView and override method setSelector is not enough, because the 
fields controlling paddings inside AbsListView are package access 
control, which prevents classes in other packages including child 
classes. One referencable example is GridViewSpecial in Andorid's 
Gallery, which inherits View drectly and implement all it needs by 
itself.</span>

</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: large;">3. Third way is use shape instead of 
images to implement desired selector, which enables you to control 
everything. Let's take a look at an example first:</span>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><textarea cols="50" rows="15" name="code" class="xhtml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;   
&lt;selector xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;&gt;  
   &lt;item android:state_window_focused=&quot;false&quot;&gt;   
      &lt;shape&gt;  
         &lt;stroke    
             android:width=&quot;2dip&quot;  android:color=&quot;#dcdcdc&quot; /&gt;
         &lt;solid android:color=&quot;000000&quot;/&gt;    
         &lt;padding    
             android:left=&quot;10dip&quot;  android:top=&quot;10dip&quot;    
             android:right=&quot;10dip&quot; android:bottom=&quot;10dip&quot; /&gt;    
      &lt;/shape&gt;  
   &lt;/item&gt;  
&lt;/selector&gt;</textarea>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: large;">This is a simple selector. For this 
selector, you can control everything: stroke width, strok color , most 
important the paddings. There are many other attributes of shape such as
 gradient, corner enabling you to create more impressive selectors.</span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although you can control the selector in more ideally way, it still causes troubles. The selector set to GridView, however, will affect your layout, even if you have set the vertical spacings and horizontal spacings. This needs you should adjust layout after setting selectors. So, implement your own GridView might be the best solution which is much easier to maintain, costly at first much easily after first pain, though.<br />
