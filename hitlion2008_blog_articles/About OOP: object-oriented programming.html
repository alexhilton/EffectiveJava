<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: green;" lang="EN-US">It&rsquo;s been more than
three decades since OOP came into this world. And the software industry has
changed a lot, too. Nowadays, software is common merchandise like toothpaste. And
OOP has become the main frame of software developing. There are also many
excellent OOP languages which provides full OOP features to developers. But
software development remains in mess. </span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: green;" lang="EN-US">OOP is a software
development method, is a design strategy. Programming in OOP supported language
is not equal to programming in OOP. All the features of OOP including inheritance,
interface, inner class, polymorphism, dynamic binding, abstraction, information
hiding should be considered in design phase. Any language can be programmed in
OOP way. Some OOP languages (Java, C++ or Python) are nothing more than supporting
those features explicitly. The truth is that a good OOP designed software can easily
be implemented with procedural language like C, only provided the design is OOP
enough.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: green;" lang="EN-US">There are many excellent
software which is implemented with C in OOP way. GTK+, for example, is fully
OOP and written in C. And there is a excellent books about programming OOP with
ANSI C called &lt;OOP with ANSI C&gt;. By now, you should be fully convinced
that OOP has nothing to do with programming language.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: green;" lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: medium;">OOP is a method, a
conception and a mind level solution. We should enhance our comprehension about
it. We should learn when and where to use those features to improve our
solutions. It is such a thing if you can use it right, it is really powerful. Otherwise,
it is really harmful and the software development process would be worse than
without using </span>
OOP.</span>
