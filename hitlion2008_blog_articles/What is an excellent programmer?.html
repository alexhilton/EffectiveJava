&nbsp; Every profession has its own elites. So does programming. Programming concerns more things than codes. It<br />
is an art other than techology. It takes practice to be an excellent programmer. An Excellent programmer<br />
shoule have:<br />
&nbsp; 1. Proficient in one or two programming langauges<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without any doubts, programming languages are the core of computer science. You don't have to learn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many languages, one or two of them is enough. But you must good at it. Here I wanna say something <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beyond this article: THERE IS NO such a language which is better or strong than others. They are all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the same following the same paradigm --- traditionally compile, assembly,linking and executing. Many<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; programmers waste a lot time arguing which is better. And many poor programmers blame the programming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; language rahter than their programming skills. For programming, the true stuff are programming skills,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data structures, algorithms, design and debugging skills. Codes or programming languages are one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; implementations. For a question, we can solve it in any language. Each language is deisgned to solve<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a kind or a range of problems. The difference is whether this language suites this problem, but not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is better than that or any one.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among all of languages, C and Java are strongly recommended. With C, you can practice your programming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skills, algorithms, data structures and debugging skills a lot. When programming in C, you are forced<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to consider many things like memory, like efficiency and like data structure which are good practice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of programming. Some other languages like Java is said to spare programmer from worrying about memory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; efficiency and data structure. That might be true, but with a lot traps in it. Only can you avoid those<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subtle traps after having a lot experiences of dealing with them. In addition, C has a close relationship<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with Unix/Linux system. Through C, it is much easier for you to master Unix/Linux system. Because all unix's<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system calls are standard C functions.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After enough with C, you should use Java. Java, however, spare you from being stuck with low-level<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detailed things like memory or data structure. It is full OO and has a very good encapisulation of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those low-level stuffs. Programming in Java, you can practice OO, design, UML, design pattern and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; software engineering a lot. Those things are extremely useful when you are building a software.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter what langauge you are mastering, try to abstract skills which is language independent. Try to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remember langauge is only one implementation.<br />
&nbsp; 2. Master one platform, including its commands, its mechanisms, system calls and kernel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like programming langauges, all operating systems follows the same conventions, too, although they<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have different names, different look and feels, different mechanisms different UI and different<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; implementations. All of them must manage resources including memory, CPU, BUS, hardwares, provide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I/O functions, provide services and provide shells for user to control the computer. By learning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one platform, you will understand all of those things. Again, when you are digging into one platform,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you should notice those platform independent features. That is our goal.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among all systems, Unix/Linux are strongly recommended. It has a clear architecture and much easier<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to learn than others.<br />
&nbsp; 3. Master OO, UML, Design Pattern and Sotfware Engineering<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any peice of application is a software, even your hello world toy. A great software is out of a great<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; architecture. A great architecture is out of a great design. A great design takes a great mind and <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other excellent skills including OO, Design Patterns.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is one thing to note: OO, UML, Design Pattern should be used in requirement phase, architecture<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phase and design phase. They are software architecture tools. Once you have built them in design, then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you can implement it in any programming language. It is a big mistake that only OO confirming languages<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can build applications in OO way. If the design is OO enough, we are able to implement it in C or assembly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which makes it well OO.<br />
&nbsp; 4. Master sufficient and essential algorithms and programming tricks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without any doubts, algorithms are soul of programming. A peice of software cannot function well by a bunch of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slow programs. But we must understand the trade-off and make the right decisions and do the right thing. In<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a word, we try to make the best thing, not fastest. Faster is not always best.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programming tricks includes&nbsp; programming styles, conventions. It concerns about clarity, readability, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extendibility, maintainability and others.<br />
&nbsp; 5. Master one or more areas of Computer Science, such as network, database, protocol, compiler,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data structure, drivers, OS, Internet, Web, algorithms or others.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All above three are concerned and necessary in every area and every applications, they are the common<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skills. While these things are your specialized area. Every software are desinged to solve problems of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an area. SQL server of Microsoft are for database. MSN are for Instant Messaging across Internet. Gcc is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a compiler. Linux is an Operating system, and so forth. Any expert or specialists dig into one or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more of these areas. By less and better rule, you had better dig into only one of them, but make it good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enough.<br />
&nbsp; In all, an excellent programmer must have a good comprehension and solid experiences on all topics discussed.<br />
Do we, you might wonder, really need so many things when we are developing a peice of software? Absolutely, every<br />
software must be consruted with programming languages, run on some platforms/Operating systems, solve a<br />
particular area problems. The solution must be based on some algorithms. The codes must be organized in a OO way.<br />
The software must be designed in OO way and comprise of Design patterns. The development of software must be<br />
supervised by software engineering paradims. </span>
