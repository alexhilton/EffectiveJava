    <p><span style="font-size:18px;">C++ Revisited</span></p><p><span style="font-size:18px;">I have learnd C++ before and I know C++.But I cannot write any piece of C++ program without compiler's complaints. Itis the time to re-visit it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:18px;">I take it as a new language though I knowsomehting about it, though I am quite familiar with C and Java. It is a newlanguage.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:18px;">Here is what I get when learning C++ andthey are worth referencing, I think, when learning C++.</span></p><ol start="1" type="1"><li><span style="font-size:18px;">C++ is a new language for you, once you are determined to learn     it, though you might know it, though you are familiar with other     programming languges like C, C# or Java.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:18px;">C++ is a superset of C. But please forget C when learning and     using C++. You know, it is a new languages(if Bjarne Stroustrup name it as     Z++ or X++, many people won't connect C with it anymore).</span></li><li><span style="font-size:18px;">Keep in mind that reference is an aliase to a variable, but not     the variable, As a result, whenever you see a reference, you should ask     yourself, what and where is the variable? Is there another aliase?</span></li><li><span style="font-size:18px;">Reference cannot be applied to literal constants</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-size:18px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><textarea readonly name="code" class="cpp">      int &amp;a = 4; // Error</textarea><br /><br /></p><ol start="5" type="1"><li><span style="font-size:18px;">For object arguments pass-by-reference; for built-in types,     pass-by-value.</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-size:18px;">Pass-by-value would invoke copy constructorand assignment operator which is costly for objects. For built-in types, copyand assign would cost too much and most times, people like passing literalconstants which would cause error if argument is pass-by-value.</span></p><textarea readonly name="code" class="cpp">        void Grade::setScore( const float &amp;sc);

         math.setScore( 89.5f ); // Error setScoreuse pass-by-reference.</textarea><br /><br /><ol start="6" type="1"><li><span style="font-size:18px;">Return object as possible as you can instead of returning     reference or pointers.</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-size:18px;">Return reference might cause fatal errors,you might return a reference to local variables.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:18px;">Returning pointers might cause memory leak.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:18px;">Return objects is much safer thoughinvoking copy constructor.</span></p><ol start="7" type="1"><li><span style="font-size:18px;">Please read &lt;Effective C++&gt; at least twice before you     write formal C++ codes.</span></li></ol>
