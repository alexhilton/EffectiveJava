can be used to implement callback function which is wildly used in many other
areas. The interface is much more powerful than class or abstract class. Interfaces
can be inherited and extended. A class can inherit multiple interfaces. </span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-style: normal;" lang="EN-US">Inner class gives us convenience to have more than one
implementation of an interface in a class. This is pretty useful in some cases
when you need to have multiple implementation of some interface or callback.
Event handlers in GUI, for instance, take a lot advantage of anonymous class. That
is also the place in which we use inner class most.</span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-style: normal;" lang="EN-US">Although they provide use more options and more powerful
solutions, interfaces and inner class should be considered in design phase. Inappropriate
usage of them could cause serious problems in implementation phase and
maintenance phase. We should learn when and where to use, rather than how to
use them. Also, we should learn to use them to improve our solutions not
causing new problems.</span>
