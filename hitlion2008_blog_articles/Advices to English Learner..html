That sounds like a pretty long time, to my shame and to your surprise, I<br />cannot speak fluent English yet, and I am still a English learner. Those years, I have tried many English Learning<br />methods, and I have worked hard and turned loose to learning. Here are some some advices to English learners based<br />on summarizing of my own learning experiences.<br />&nbsp; 1. If you want something, work for it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No pains, no gains. Trust me, there is nothing that you can get it without <br />paying any efforts. This is the same to there is no such thing like free lunch. If you wanna speak fluent English<br />you have to pay much more efforts than you ever thought and than you ever saw.<br />&nbsp; 2. Culture gap is the biggest obstacle to master English.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you have a impressive vovabulary, perhaps your pronunciation is perfect. But before you can think in<br />the way which westerns do, you have not mastered English yet. Language is the vehicle of human thoughts. Language<br />is the tools of communications, language is the representative of culture. The foreigners would feel rather<br />weird if you ask them about their salaries, their parents, or they might be offended, though you use the standard<br />American tone.<br />&nbsp; 3. Pronunciation is everything.<br />&nbsp; 4. Recite some arctiles, some is enough, don't be many.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the standard tone, standard pronunciation, starndard innotation to recite some articles. That benifits you<br />more than tens of text books and examnation couches.<br />&nbsp; 5. Listen music and watch movies with your heart. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are best learning materials. They are most real thing. You can learn a lot of things from them, including<br />pronunciation, innotation, culture, idioms and words. Try to remember some well written lyrics or movie scripts<br />and show it off to your arounds.<br />&nbsp; 6. Immerse yourself in a full English environment.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to use english computer operating systems, use english software, read english books, visit english<br />websites. Make yourself in english world as much as possible.<br />&nbsp; 7. After you have made some progresses, you can change your learning strategy.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can try use english rather than learning them solely. If you are learning some new topics or skills you can<br />try english version text books.<br />&nbsp; 8. Talk to yourself are the best way to practice.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no other campanion which is better than yourself. There is no other guy who knows better of you than your-<br />self. You are the best partner to practice. And you are the most loyal guy to trust.<br />&nbsp; 9. Learn with your heart and full attentions.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a general rule for learning. Concentration can improve your productivity.<br />&nbsp; 10. Thinking why always.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost everything on this planet are connected in some ways. The relationships between objects are sutle<br />and interesting. When you saw a phrase on some advertising tab or in a movie, think why it is created that way.<br />Try to summarize somethings that is general. And you can apply it to other aspect of languages, or even other<br />things in life.<br />你可能没有注意到， 我们能应用的东西只有在我们脑子中已经被激活的。比如说英语， 如果说一个单词在你的脑子中已被告激活， 那么你可随时随地地说出来， 翻译它， 听懂它和写下它。很多人的词汇量大的惊人，但是他仍然不能听懂， 不能写下， 不能翻译。因为他是在机械地去记忆单词， 这些单词虽然被记住了， 但是从来没被激活， 所以你听不懂， 写不出， 翻不了， 也说不出。因此我们在学习英语的时候，要努力去增加脑子中的活动词汇量。光有单词也是不够的， 还要多增加些英语句子，成语等。外国人从不像我们那样辛苦的学习英语， 但是他们的英语都很好， 他们能说的出， 写的下， 听的懂很多很多。所以在学习英语的时候， 我们要调动心眼耳手嘴。每学习一个新单词， 新句子都要达到说的出， 听的懂， 写的下，译的来。这样的有时也会忘， 还有一个关键的步骤就是用，可能是听， 说， 写或译。一旦你在真实情况下用成功子， 那你真正掌握了这个单词， 这个单词也真正的被激活了， 它会一直在你的脑子中， 你可以随时调出来用。怎么才能用呢， 一定要真实的环境才会有好的效果， 有三种方法，到外国去或找外国人；自己练，自己说给自己听， 自己写给自己， 自己译给自己；另一种方法就是看原声电影， 最好看二遍， 第一次看难免会被电影情节吸引，第二次看你才有可能去学习英语， 尽量先听， 自己译，然后再去看字幕， 如果遇到一个词或句子， 你好像见过， 却又说不清什么意思， 这就是以前学习了但还没有被激活的， 马上再学一遍它就被激活了！</span><br />
