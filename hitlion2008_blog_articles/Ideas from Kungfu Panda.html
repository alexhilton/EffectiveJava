    <span style="font-size:18px;">I love &lt;Kungfu Panda&gt; so much, and I have seen it for a dozen of times.<br />Everytime I saw it, many special feelings came to me. Through it, we can get a<br /></span><p><span style="font-size:18px;">lot of valuable insights about our daily life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><br /></span></p><span style="font-size:18px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, there are no accident. This is probably true.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, there is no secret. Yes, that is absolutely true. There is no royal road<br />to success. If you want something, you have to work hard for it. Our forefather<br />has told us that we can get anything we want and become anyone we want to be if<br />we work hard enough.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, to make something special, you have to believe it special first.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, you can be the 'draggon warrior' if you dreamt of it a lot. Because that<br />is your favorite, your fello. That is your interests, that is your intuition.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, a true master can always find the way. Shifu did not believe that Paul<br />can turn into draggon warrior at the first time, either. Later on, he began to<br />trust that. But he cannot find a proper way to train and guide Paul. Master is a<br />Master. Eventually, he found a way to make Paul qualified to become draggon<br />warrior. That was the inspiration besides despairs. He made a miracle in<br />kungfu's history. He made Panda the draggon warrior. Here is the living proof<br />that all great people are out of great master.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, be yourself. In our whole life, we are trying to change ourselves. We<br />are told by others how to be a solide one. And of course, many of us have lost<br />of ourselves during the pursuit of being somebody. All of us were wrong. Every<br />of ourselves is unique in this universe. We don't have to be others. We need to<br />be ourselves, only. We need to find our soul, listen our voice and follow our<br />heart.<br /><br /></span><br />
