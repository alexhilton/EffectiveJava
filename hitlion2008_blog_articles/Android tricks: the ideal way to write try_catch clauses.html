 Here we talk about how to write try/catch/finally clauses in a more elegant way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">Here, we take I/O operations as our illustrated example, because I/O conerns three important steps when using: initialization, exception handing and cleanup.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">Generally, some programmer might write like this:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"></span></p>
<textarea readonly name="code" class="java">// Declaration of objects
InputStream input = null;
OutputStream output = null;
try {
     // Initialization input and output
     input = new FileInputStream(&quot;readme.txt&quot;);
     output = new FileOutputStream(&quot;ic_card.txt&quot;);
     
     // Operations
     int seg = 0;
     byte[] buf = new byte[4096];
     while ((seg = input.read(buf)) != -1) {
          output.write(buf, 0, seg);
     }
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
     // handling exception
} catch (IOException e) {
     // handling exception
} finally {
     // cleanup
     try {
          if (input != null) {
             input.close();
          }
          if (output != null) {
             output.close();
          }
      } catch (IOException e) { 
          // handling exception
      }
}</textarea><span style="font-size:18px">Such style has the following problems:</span>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size:18px">There are extra try/catch inside outer try/catch to catch the same exception, which is might be redundant</span></li><li><span style="font-size:18px">The variable input/output are declared beyond where they are needed, which have unnecessary life circle</span></li><li><span style="font-size:18px">Two try/catch and try/catch in finally, which might be not elegant enough</span></li></ol>
<span style="font-size:18px">The suggested way is like this:</span>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">This try/finally try/catch style is superior to previous version is because, it finishes all the tasks: declaration, initialization, operations and cleanup. All blocks are inside big try/catch so that all exceptions are get caught;
 Cleanup is inside try/finally so that we ensure to release taken resources. It also looks elegant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">Such try/finally try/catch clauses, however, have a fatal defect that exceptions could be ignored and lost. In try/finally, finally block gets executed even if when exceptions are thrown in try block. If finally block also throws
 exceptions, ones thrown in try blocks are ignored and lost. Outer catch clauses will never catch them. In all, this style might not catch all exceptions thrown in try blocks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">You can apply this try/finally try/catch style when:</span></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size:18px">cleanup codes are not much and quite simple, like closing IO streams, shutdown connection.etc.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:18px">cleanup codes are not likely to throw exceptions, or much less than initializations and operations.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:18px">you do not care what exceptions are, but whether there are exceptions thrown</span></li></ol>
<span style="font-size:18px">Besides these, you should use try/catch/finally, when specific exceptions are important in particular.</span><textarea readonly name="code" class="java">// Delcarations
