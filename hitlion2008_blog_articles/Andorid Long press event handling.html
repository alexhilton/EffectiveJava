 or implementing <span style="color:#000099">View.OnTouchEvent</span>. For the common widgets, you can also implement these two interfaces and set them to widgets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">Now you must wanna know the differences between <span style="color:#000099">
View.OnLongClickListener </span>and <span style="color:#000099">View.OnTouchEvent</span> when handling long press event:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">1. <span style="color:#000099">View.OnLongClickListener</span>&nbsp; has only one method and will be called only once, which is much similar to
<span style="color:#000099">View.OnClickListener</span>. And the callback event is fired off after the action of long pressing, i.e. the
<span style="color:#000099">onLongClick()</span> is called when you release your fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">2. <span style="color:#000099">View.OnTouchEvent</span>, however, is a little big complex. You have to recognize current actions and do proper responses, i.e. you have to get the actions from
<span style="color:#000099">MotionEvent</span> object and test what kind of action is and then do proper responses.
<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">Generally speaking, you have to handle four types of actions:<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color:#660000">MotionEvent.<em>ACTION_DOWN</em></span> ---- user has pressed on your view</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#660000">MotionEvent.<em>ACTION_MOVE</em></span> ---- user is moving on your view</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-size:18px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color:#660000">
MotionEvent.<em>ACTION_UP</em></span> ---- user has released his fingers</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-size:18px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color:#660000">
MotionEvent.<em>ACTION_CANCEL</em></span> ---- user has aborted his actions, released his fingers, etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#000099">onTouch()</span> is hard to implement, though, it is powerful and flexible enough to handle any event you want.<span style="color:#000099">View.OnLongClick()</span>, for instance, can be implemented
 with onTouch. Firing off<span style="color:#000099">onLongClick()</span> when getting
<span style="font-size:18px; color:#660000"><span style="font-size:18px">MotionEvent.<em>ACTION_UP</em></span></span> in onTouch is eough to handle the long click event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">In all, if you want to do some separate tasks when long pressing, like pop up some menus, or pop up a notification or enter into another screen or activities, you should use<span style="color:#000099">View.OnLongClickListener.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">But if you want to change some states or interact with other tasks, or need to know the details of user actions, you should implement<span style="color:#000099">View.OnTouchEvent</span>. For instance, if you wanna control something
 should only happen when long pressing a button, you can use a flag which turn it on when<span style="color:#660000"><em>ACTION_DOWN</em></span> and turn it off when
<em><span style="color:#660000">ACTION_UP.</span></em><br>
</span></p>
