 to finishing the task. But it never worked in the way I expected. The script was simple just reading target file line by line, then testing whether matching the patterns which read from files and chomped, if matching adding the tag. But it never worked, the
 line never matched the pattern, even they did match.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">Suddenly, I realized the problem, the file containing the patterns was created in Windows XP, but I read and chomped it in Linux, So newline terminator '\r\n' was not chomped completely. As a result, lines never matched patterns
 except for last pattern, which was last line of that file and did not contain newline. So when ran it in Windows XP, I got expected results.<br>

open SOURCE, $src or die &quot;failed to open $src, $!&quot;;
chomp(@strings = &lt;SOURCE&gt;);
print &quot;@strings\n&quot;;</span></textarea><span style="font-size:18px">Here is the output running in Linux:</span></p>

This is a trivial issue, but revealing an idea that real platform independence is nothing. Nothing can run correctly without a change across different platforms. C, C&#43;&#43;, so called platform independent, but you have to pay extra attentions to word size, byte
 order and architecture gaps between different platforms. Java so called &quot;compile once run everywhere&quot;, byte code is indeed platform independent, but byte code must run upon Java Virtual Machine, which is absolutely platform dependent, as a result, Java is
 platform dependent, to some extent at least!<br>
